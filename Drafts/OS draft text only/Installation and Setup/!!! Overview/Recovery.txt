This setup was designed to be as advanced as possible, even though it should
only be a one time thing for the host system. 
Every byte is secured, so if something goes wrong, like a memory error, power
outage, unplug, or other thing that disrupts the installation, it doesn't have
to completely restart art errors, and will start back at the most recent safe state of
installation. There are also a couple memory checks during installation to show
the user what is going on behind the scenes, along with error checks to catch all 
installation errors.
